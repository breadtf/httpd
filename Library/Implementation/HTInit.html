<H1>Initialization Module</H1>

This module resisters all the plug &amp; play software modules which will
be used in the program on client side (The server has it's own initialization
module). The module is a part of the <A HREF="Overview.html">CERN Common WWW
Library</A>. <P>

The initialization consists of two phases: Setting up the MIME type conversions
and defining the relation between a basic set of file suffixes and MIME types. 
To override this, just copy it and link in your version before you link
with the library.<P>

Implemented by <A NAME="z0" HREF="HTInit.c">HTInit.c</A> by default.

<H2>MIME Type Conversions</H2>

Two default functions can be used to do the MIME type initialization. The
first contains all MIME types the client can handle <B>plus</B> the types
that can be handled using save and execute calls, e.g. to start a PostScript
viewer. The second function only contains MIME type conversions that can
be handled internally in the client. As an example, the latter is used
when <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/LineMode/Status.html">
Line Mode Browser</A> is started in Non-Interactive mode.

<H2>File Suffix Setup</H2>

This functions defines a basic set of file suffixes and the corresponding
MIME types.
