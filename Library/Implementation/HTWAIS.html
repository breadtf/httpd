<H1>WAIS Protocol Interface</H1>

This module does not actually perform the WAIS protocol directly, but it
does using one or more libraries of the freeWAIS distribution. The
ui.a library came with the old free WAIS from TMC,  the client.a and
wais.a libraries are needed from the freeWAIS from CNIDR. <P>

<EM><B>Note: </B>The current version suppored is freeWAIS-0.3, June 1994</EM><P>

If you include this module in the library, you must also

<UL>
<LI> Register the HTWAIS protocol at initialisation (e.g. HTInit or HTSInit)
     by compiling it with -DDIRECT_WAIS
<LI> Link with the WAIS libraries
</UL>

The wais source files are parsed by a separate and independent module,
<A NAME="z1" HREF="HTWSRC.html">HTWSRC</A>.  You can include HTWSRC
without including direct wais using this module, and your WWW code will
be able to read source files, and access WAIS indexes through a gateway.<P>

A <A NAME="z2" HREF="../../Daemon/WAISGate.html">WAIS-WWW gateway</A>
is just a normal W3 server with a libwww compiled with this module.<P>

Anyways, this interface won't change much:

<PRE>
#ifndef HTWAIS_H
#define HTWAIS_H
#include "HTUtils.h"
#include "HTAccess.h"
</PRE>

<H2>Control Flags</H2>

The number of lines handled from a WAIS search is determined by this variable.
The default value is 100 (this is defined in the module)

<PRE>
extern int HTMaxWAISLines;

GLOBALREF HTProtocol HTWAIS;
</PRE>

End of Difinition module

<PRE>
#endif
