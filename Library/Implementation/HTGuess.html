<TITLE>HTGuess: Guess content-type from a stream</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Content-Type Guesser</H1>

This stream is a one that reads first a chunk of stuff, tries to
figure out the format, and calls <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>.  This
is a kind of lazy-evaluation of <CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. <P>

This could be extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible
file formats in the world, if someone only had time to do it. <P>

Part of <A HREF="Overview.html">libwww</A>. Implemented by <A
HREF="HTGuess.c"><CODE>HTGuess.c</CODE></A>. <P>
