<BODY>
<H1>MIME Parser</H1>The MIME parser stream presents a
MIME document. It recursively invokes
the format manager to handle embedded
formats.<P>
As well as stripping off and parsing
the headers, the MIME parser has
to parse any weirld MIME encodings
it may meet within the body parts
of messages, and must deal with multipart
messages. <P>
This module is implemented to the
level necessary for operation with
WWW, but is not currently complete
for any arbitrary MIME message.<P>
Check the <A
NAME="z0" HREF="HTMIME.c">source</A> for latest additions
to functionality.<P>
The MIME parser is complicated by
the fact that WWW allows real binary
to be sent, not ASCII encoded.  Therefore
the netascii decoding is included
in this module. One cannot layer
it by converting first from Net to
local text, then decoding it. Of
course, for local files, the net
ascii decoding is not needed.  There
are therefore two creation routines.
