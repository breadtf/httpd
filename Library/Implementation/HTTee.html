<H1>Tee stream</H1>This is part of <A
NAME="z1" HREF="Overview.html">libwww</A> .  The Tee
stream just writes everything you
put into it into two oter streams.<P>
One use (the only use?!) is for taking
a cached copey on disk while loading
the main copy, without having to
wait for the disk copy to be finished
and reread it.
<PRE>#include "HTStream.h"

extern HTStream * HTTee PARAMS((HTStream* s1, HTStream* s2));
