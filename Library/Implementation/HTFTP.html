<H2>Public Functions</H2>

Theese are the public functions...

<H3>Accessing FTP-Server</H3>

<PRE>
extern int  HTLoadFTP PARAMS((HTRequest * request));
</PRE>

<H3>Enable/Disable Reuse of Control Connections on Client Side</H3>

The next two functions are for enabling and disabling reuse og control
connections on client side. Though, this is a temporary solution as the
library is going to be multi-threaded and then the control of open
connections changes. Reuse of control connections is mainly intended for use
when loading several files from the same server in the same directory, but
changing directory IS supported using FTP-commands CDUP and CWD.

<PRE>
extern void HTFTP_enable_session NOPARAMS;
extern BOOL HTFTP_disable_session NOPARAMS;
</PRE>

<H3>Various Functions to parse information</H3>

Theese functions are necessary in order to keep the internal data structures
hidden.

<PRE>
PUBLIC HTChunk *HTFTPWelcomeMsg PARAMS ((HTNetInfo *data));
PUBLIC BOOL HTFTUseList PARAMS ((HTNetInfo *data));
</PRE>

<H2>Flags for FTP connections</H2>

Those are the flags for configuring the FTP client.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTFTPUserInfo;
extern long HTFTPTimeOut;
</PRE>

If HTFTPUserInfo = YES (as pr default) then the users login name and password
is reused when conneting to the same host. It is, however, overwritten by any
userid and passwd specified in the URL. This is only for the client side, as
server forks itself on any request. If this flag is not set, then anonymous
and username of the current proces is used. <P>

In addition, the following defines are available in the module: <P>

<DL>
<DT>LISTEN 
<DD>This defines makes it possible to use PORT and hence do an passive
open for the data connection. Though, if defined, this is only used AFTER
an active open has been tried using PASV.
<DT>REPEAT_PORT
<DD>If LISTEN is defined, then when we have found a passive port, then reuse
it for the next time, else we ask the system to get a new one.
<DT>POLL_PORTS
<DD>If the system doesn't support finding a new port, then let's try it
ourselves.
