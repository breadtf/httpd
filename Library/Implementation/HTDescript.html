<H1>File Descriptions</H1>

Descriptions appearing in directory listings are produced by this
module.  This may be overridden by another module for those who which
descriptions to come from somewhere else. <P>

<PRE>

#ifndef HTDESCRIPT_H
#define HTDESCRIPT_H

</PRE>


<H2>Description File</H2>

This module gets descriptions from the file defined by global variable
<CODE>HTHTDesctiptionFile</CODE> in the same directory. The default
value is <CODE>.www_descript</CODE>:
<PRE>
extern char * HTDescriptionFile;
</PRE>

In the description file lines starting with a word starting with 'D'
are taken to be descriptions (this looks funny now, but this is to
make it easy to extend these description files to contain also other
information.
<PRE>
/*
 * Example:
 *	DESCRIBE  welcome.html	Our welcome page
 *	DESCRIBE  map*.gif	Map as a GIF image
 *	DESCRIBE  map*.ps	Map as a PostScript image
 */
</PRE>



<H2>HTML Titles</H2>

If description is not specified for a file that is of type
<CODE>text/html</CODE>, this module uses the HTML TITLE as the
description.  This feature can be turned off by setting the
<CODE>HTPeekTitles</CODE> variable to false.
<PRE>
extern BOOL HTPeekTitles;
</PRE>


<H2>Read Description File</H2>

The description file for a directory is read in only once by
<CODE>HTReadDescriptions()</CODE>, and the result returned by it is
given as an argument when finding out a description for a single file.
<PRE>
PUBLIC HTList * HTReadDescriptions PARAMS((char * dirname));
</PRE>


<H2>Get Description For a File</H2>

Once description file has been read and the list of descriptions is
returned by <CODE>HTReadDescriptions()</CODE>, the function
<CODE>HTGetDescription()</CODE> can be used to get a description for a
given file:
<PRE>
PUBLIC char * HTGetDescription PARAMS((HTList *	descriptions,
				       char *	dirname,
				       char *	filename,
				       HTFormat	format));
</PRE>
Directory name has to be present because this function may then take a
peek at the file itself (to get the HTML TITLE, for example).
If <CODE>format</CODE> is <CODE>WWW_HTML</CODE> and description is not
found, this module may be configured to use the HTML TITLE as the
description. <P>

<STRONG>No string returned by this function should be freed!</STRONG>


<H2>Freeing Descriptions</H2>

Once descriptions have been gotten, the description list returned by
<CODE>HTReadDescriptions()</CODE> must be freed by
<CODE>HTFreeDescriptions()</CODE>:
<PRE>
PUBLIC void HTFreeDescriptions PARAMS((HTList * descriptions));
</PRE>

<PRE>
#endif /* !HTDESCRIPT_H */
</PRE>
End of <CODE>HTDescript.h</CODE>.
