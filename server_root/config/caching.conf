#
#	Set this to point to the directory where you unpacked this
#	distribution, or wherever you want httpd to have its "home"
#
ServerRoot	/where/ever/server_root

#
#	Set the port for proxy to listen to
#
Port	8080

#
#	General setup; on some systems, like HP, nobody is defined so
#	that setuid() fails; in those cases use a different user id.
#
UserId	nobody
GroupId	nogroup

#
#	Logging; if you want logging uncomment these lines and specify
#	locations for your access and error logs
#
# AccessLog	/where/ever/proxy-log
# ErrorLog	/where/ever/proxy-errors
LogFormat	Common
LogTime		LocalTime

#
#	Proxy protections; if you want only certain domains to use
#	your proxy, uncomment these lines and specify the Mask
#	with hostname templates or IP number templates:
#
# Protection PROXY-PROT {
# 	ServerId	YourProxyName
# 	Mask		@(*.cern.ch, 128.141.*.*, *.ncsa.uiuc.edu)
# }
# Protect  *  PROXY-PROT

#
#	Pass the URLs that this proxy is willing to forward.
#
Pass	http:*
Pass	ftp:*
Pass	gopher:*
Pass	wais:*

#
#	Enable caching, specify cache root directory, and cache size
#	in megabytes
#
Caching		On
CacheRoot	/your/cache/root/dir
CacheSize	5

#
#	Specify absolute maximum for caching time
#
CacheClean	*	2 months

#
#	Specify the maximum time to be unused
#
CacheUnused	http:*		2 weeks
CacheUnused	ftp:*		1 week
CacheUnused	gopher:*	1 week

#
#	Specify default expiry times for ftp and gopher;
#	NEVER specify it for HTTP, otherwise documents generated by
#	scripts get cached which is usually a bad thing.
#
CacheDefaultExpiry	ftp:*		10 days
CacheDefaultExpiry	gopher:*	2 days

#
#	Garbage collection controls; daily garbage collection at 3am;
#
Gc		On
