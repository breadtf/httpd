#	Set this to point to the directory where you unpacked this
#	distribution, or wherever you want httpd to have its "home"
#
ServerRoot	/where/ever/server_root

#
#	The default port for HTTP is 80; if you are not root you have
#	to use a port above 1024; good defaults are 8000, 8001, 8080
#
Port	80

#	General setup; on some systems, like HP, nobody is defined so
#	that setuid() fails; in those cases use a different user id.

#	locations for your access and error logs
#

LogTime		LocalTime

#
#	User-supported directories under ~/public_html
#
